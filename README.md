## (not so) Short bio.

I live in Bordeaux (France) and I'm the co-founder and CTO at [Kune.travel][kune.travel]. 

I love both theorical and practical computer science. Which means I find pleasure in solving abstract maths
problems but I also love to cheat and use a computer to solve problems for me. That being said you probably 
guessed that my favorite programming language is [python][python], I like it so much I even use it for 
non-research related problems. At Kune, we use python for most our web services. I'm also very curious 
about [react-native][RN] that I've used daily for quite a while now (~2 years).

I'm a former postdoctoral researcher at [Politecnico di Torino][polito] and phd. student at [LaBRI][labri].
My research mainly focuses on graph problems (mostly [routing schemes][routing schemes], [leader election problems][leader election] and [vehicular network][vanet]). 

More details about my research on [dblp][dblp]/[Research Gate][rs gate]/[Google Scholar][google scholar], my less geeky profile is available on [LinkedIn][linkedin]. Feel free to contact me on any of these platform, especially if you come with computer science problems, questions or even answers.

Some achivements I absolutely need to share:  

- I published to: **SODA**, **PODC**, **INFOCOM**, **TALG** and **DISC**.
- I have an **[Erdős number][erdos number] of 3**: 
  Christian Glacet [→][ref1]
  Avery Miller [→][ref3] 
  Jeffrey Shallit [→][ref2] 
  Paul Erdős
 - I have **[Bacon number][bacon number] of 4**: 
  Christian Glacet [→][hard corner] 
  Benjamin Daniel [→][visiteur du futur] 
  Samuel Brafman [→][grace of monaco] 
  Nicole Kidman [→][in the cut]
  Kevin Bacon 
<!--
- Favorites computer science related topic:
   * [discrete mathematics][discrete maths]/algorithms,
   * [computational complexity],
   * design patterns and programming paradigms,
   * and of course puzzles and riddles of any kind!
-->

Any opportunity to **lower my Bacon number to 3** is more than welcome. Note that I'm an awful actor so you better arm yourself with patience and low expectetions.

At some point in time I sarted writing some [notes on various computer programming topics][blog] but saddly I don't have enough time to write quality content about this. I'll get back to it next time I have the opportunity to teach :).
